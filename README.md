# Project Singular Point / Rodan Initiative

#### Introduction

I've remodelled this to be an application rather than a webpage, leveraging [guark](https://github.com/guark/guark).

I'm now calling this project "Singular Point" as a reference to the Godzilla show and as this is intended to be a singular point for all my records. This front-end / C&C app is under the Rodan Initiative.

While this was first started for financial record keeping, I'm expanding it to various things like my personal projects.

#### Running and building

```bash
 # dev server
 guark run

 # bundling
 guark build
 guark bundle
```
