I've wanted to make a custom home page for a little bit, and felt like it would be worthwhile to combine this with expense tracking. This is just supposed to be a small personal project.
For now this only includes inputting new expenses, and the code is quick an dirty. I'll be adding to this as I feel like it.

This project used [this article](https://www.techomoro.com/how-to-create-a-multi-page-website-with-react-in-5-minutes/) to help understand the basis of creating a single-page-application.

Code is a mess and absolutely needs refactoring, but at this point in time it works as I want it to so I'm not too bothered about the code.
